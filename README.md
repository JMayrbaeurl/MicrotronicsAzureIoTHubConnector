# Microtronics Azure IoT Hub ConnectorThis is a sample showing how to connect and integrate [Microtronics rapidM2M Backend ](https://www.microtronics.at/en/products/m2m-platform.html)service to [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/). Warning: **Not production ready code**. Check constraints section below.![alt text](./Assets/IntegrationArchitecture.PNG)### How it worksUsing a time triggered [Azure Function App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) (Azure's serverless implementation) the Microtronics m2m Backend middleware is called regularly (default setting is once a minute) via its REST API by using the 'Site's time series data' method to retrieve the newest available telemetry data. Polling requests and their results get stored in an [Azure DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/documentdb/) collection and are finally forwarded to Azure IoT Hub.  ### Installation You will need the following components to use or run this sample:1. Azure subscription (You can get one for free [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)) with Azure DocumentDB account and Azure IoT Hub instance deployed2. Visual Studio 2015 (at least Community edition) with Git support3. Access to a Microtronics M2M Backend instance ([playground works too](https://www.microtronics.at/en/service/cloud_service.html))### Configuration- Scheduling for the Function App time trigger can be found in the file located at .\rapidM2MPoller\rapidM2MForwarding\function.json. For more details on configuring Time triggered Azure functions see the documentation on the [Azure website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer).- Application configuration can be found in the file .\rapidM2MPoller\application.json.    - M2MBackendURL: URL of the Microtronics m2m Backend service installation    - Base64encodedUsernamePassword: Base64 encoded username and password (see [Microtronics API documentation](http://support.mydatanet.at/quick_guide/ApiDocumentationV1.pdf))    - Customer_ID: customer identifier from Microtronics installation    - Site_ID: site identifier from Microtronics installation    - EmulationMode: True or False. On True no data from m2m Backend will be polled    - M2MDocumentsDBUri: Azure DocumentDB database Uri. Database and collection will be created if not existing    - M2MDocumentsDBPrimaryKey: Primary key from the Azure DocumentDB account
    - IoTHubURL: Hostname of the Azure IoT Hub instance like [yourname].azure-devices.net 
    - IoTHubDeviceId: Device Id for the Azure IoT Hub (must be registered on IoT Hub)    - IoTHubSharedAccessSignature: Shared access signature for the IoT Hub device, e.g. generated by Device Explorer App### Constraints- Only one Microtronic's customer site/device currently supported- Function must not be called multiple times. No concurrent support yet- No extensive failure handling implemented and no retry logic### Sample output message```{    "customer_id": "Your customer Id",    "site_id": "Energy meter 1",    "Timerange": {      "begin": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",      "end": "2017-02-16T13:09:24.7744931-08:00"    },    "Timeseries": [      {        "Timestamp": "2017-01-26T13:30:00",        "Channels": {          "ch0": 51000        }      }    ]  }  ```
